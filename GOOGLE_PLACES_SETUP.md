# üöÄ Google Places API Setup Guide

## Why Switch to Google Places API?

The old OpenStreetMap API was giving terrible results like "Goodwill Avenue" (a street name) instead of actual Goodwill stores. Google Places API gives you:

- ‚úÖ **Real businesses** with actual addresses and phone numbers
- ‚úÖ **Star ratings** and reviews 
- ‚úÖ **Accurate locations** within 5-30km
- ‚úÖ **5 results per search** instead of empty or bad results
- ‚úÖ **No timeouts** - reliable and fast
- ‚úÖ **Business hours** and contact info

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Get Google Places API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable **Places API** and **Places API (New)**
4. Go to **APIs & Credentials** ‚Üí **Credentials**
5. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** ‚Üí **API Key**
6. Copy your API key

### 2. Add to Your Environment

Add this line to your `backend/.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test It!

Restart your Flask server and try uploading furniture, electronics, or clothing. You should now see real businesses like:

- **Goodwill Industries** (not "Goodwill Avenue")
- **Best Buy Recycling Center** (not "Best Buy Avenue") 
- **Salvation Army Family Store** (not "Salvation Army Road")

## API Costs

- **FREE tier**: 5,000 requests/month
- **After free tier**: ~$0.017 per request
- **Typical usage**: 20-50 requests/day = $0.34-$0.85/month

## Fallback System

If you don't set up the API key, the system will:
- Show a warning in logs
- Return generic placeholder locations
- Still work, just with basic results
